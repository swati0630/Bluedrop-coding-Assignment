    -   Language: **JavaScript**
    -   Framework: **React**

-   Implement search by connecting to `https://wookie.codesubmit.io/movies?q=<search_term>`

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code in the repository. To make reviewing easier, include a fully built version of your assignment in a folder named **src**.
